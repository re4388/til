Question:
What use of mind map?

ANS:
Mind map is good cuz it "decompose" what you need to know to learn.

In my previous entries, I described _learning_ is to setup a **mental function** that will help me to **get** the answer **given** the question I have, so it's just a function with input & output.

A complicated learning (abstractly, fn), require many small "fn" combinations between the original input to the final output. And I need to know each fn independently, via **divided and conquer**, in order to complete the learning or get the whole fn.

And a good mind map help us to decompose this bug fn into many small fn.

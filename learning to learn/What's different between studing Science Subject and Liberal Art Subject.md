Q:

What's different between studying Science Subject and Liberal Art Subject?

A:

Contrast to **science subject**, when studying **liberal art** subject, students might just need to **memory** the material to get a good grade.

But, **memory** is different from **learning**

What is **learning**?

Learning is **finding a function**. First, we get many examples to understand and then gradually setup the relationship of question and answer. It's just like function, input and output, question and answer. And once we learned it, meaning that we can use this function by providing new input and get the new output.

The above learning process is actually how our human brain wired, as long as you get more understanding of the "function", those knowledge you learned also gradually store into my long term memory(LTM).

And liberal art subject is just a constant output function, a special case of a general function.

Finally, student can benefit use the "fn" learning way as well when study liberal art subject by using "recall" with different context"
